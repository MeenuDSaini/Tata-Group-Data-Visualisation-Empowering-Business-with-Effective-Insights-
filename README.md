# Tata Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights
## Overview
This repository contains the work completed during the Tata Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights Job Simulation, completed in December 2024 on Forage. In this simulation, I acted as a consultant for an online retail store to analyze business performance data, create data visualizations, and provide insights for the CEO and CMO. The aim was to support strategic decision-making for the company’s expansion plans, ensuring the leadership team could leverage insights to make informed, data-driven choices.

## The project involved four main tasks:

**1. Understanding Business Requirements:** Crafting the right questions for the CEO and CMO to identify key business insights.
**Choosing the Right Visuals:** Selecting appropriate visualizations for different business scenarios.
**Creating Data Visualizations:** Using Tableau or Power BI to create visuals based on the data and business needs.
**Presenting Findings:** Preparing and recording a video presentation of the analysis and insights for senior leadership.

## Project Objectives
**Analyze Business Data:** Gather data-driven insights from both marketing and operational perspectives to help the leadership team assess performance and opportunities.
**Create Effective Visualizations:** Choose and create visuals that are easy to understand and communicate key findings.
**Assist in Strategic Decision-Making:** Provide visual insights that assist in making informed decisions, especially regarding business 
  expansion.
**Improve Data Presentation Skills:** Develop the ability to present data and insights clearly to senior leadership, explaining both the 
  analysis and the decision-making process.

## Key Activities:

**1. Understanding Business Requirements (Task 1)**
- I started by analyzing the business requirements for an online retail store. The CEO and CMO were keen to understand how the business 
  was performing and identify growth opportunities.
- I drafted key questions that would be relevant for both executives to ensure the data visualizations answered their business needs.

**2. Choosing the Right Visuals (Task 2)**
- I identified and selected the best visualizations for each business scenario based on the requirements provided by the CEO and CMO.
- The task required careful consideration to ensure the visual representation was easy to interpret and conveyed the insights effectively. 
  I used best practices for choosing the right chart types, such as:
* Bar charts for comparing categories.
* Line graphs for showing trends over time.
* Pie charts for representing proportions.
- This step ensured that each metric was represented in the simplest, most effective manner to support clear decision-making.
  
**3. Creating Data Visualizations (Task 3)**
- After gathering the requirements and selecting appropriate visualizations, I used Power BI to create the visuals.
- The visuals focused on analyzing trends and breakdowns by categories to help the executives understand how revenue is generated and what 
  factors affect the business.
- I cleaned and preprocessed the data before building the visuals to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the analysis.
  
**4. Presenting Findings to Senior Leadership (Task 4)**
- The final task involved creating a video presentation to showcase the findings and explain the insights from the analysis.
- I provided an overview of the data, the analysis process, the visuals created, and the key insights that would help in business  
  expansion.
- I ensured that the presentation was clear, concise, and tailored to the needs of the CEO and CMO, focusing on areas that offer the most 
  potential for growth.
