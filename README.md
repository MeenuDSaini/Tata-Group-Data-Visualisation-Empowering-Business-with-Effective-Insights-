# Tata Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights
## Overview
This repository contains the work completed during the Tata Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights Job Simulation, completed in December 2024 on Forage. In this simulation, I acted as a consultant for an online retail store to analyze business performance data, create data visualizations, and provide insights for the CEO and CMO. The aim was to support strategic decision-making for the company’s expansion plans, ensuring the leadership team could leverage insights to make informed, data-driven choices.

## The project involved four main tasks:

**1. Understanding Business Requirements:** Crafting the right questions for the CEO and CMO to identify key business insights.
**Choosing the Right Visuals:** Selecting appropriate visualizations for different business scenarios.
**Creating Data Visualizations:** Using Tableau or Power BI to create visuals based on the data and business needs.
**Presenting Findings:** Preparing and recording a video presentation of the analysis and insights for senior leadership.

## Project Objectives
**Analyze Business Data:** Gather data-driven insights from both marketing and operational perspectives to help the leadership team assess performance and opportunities.
**Create Effective Visualizations:** Choose and create visuals that are easy to understand and communicate key findings.
**Assist in Strategic Decision-Making:** Provide visual insights that assist in making informed decisions, especially regarding business 
  expansion.
**Improve Data Presentation Skills:** Develop the ability to present data and insights clearly to senior leadership, explaining both the 
  analysis and the decision-making process.

## Key Activities:

**1. Understanding Business Requirements (Task 1)**
- I started by analyzing the business requirements for an online retail store. The CEO and CMO were keen to understand how the business 
  was performing and identify growth opportunities.
- I drafted key questions that would be relevant for both executives to ensure the data visualizations answered their business needs.
-Here are the questions I framed:
**As CEO is responsible for the overall success of the organization so he might be interested in these questions:**

**1.What are the top-performing products and least-performing products in terms of total revenue?**

This information helps to identify bestsellers and reasons behind their success. Also in understanding why the other products are in low demand - whether due to quality issues, lack of awareness, or other factors and can guide strategies to improve their performance and increase the overall revenue.                                            

**2.Which countries or regions generate the highest and lowest revenue?**   

CEOs are often curious about geographical performances to pinpoint the regions driving success and to identify the underperforming areas. This analysis can guide strategies to improve the underperforming areas to improve the sale and revenue.                                                                                              

**3.What is the monthly trend in sales or revenue?**                                                                  

Analysing monthly trends can reveal the seasonal patterns, festive spikes, or product launch impacts. Understanding the reasons behind the maximum and minimum sales- such as seasonality, product demand, quality concerns or delays- can help optimize the performance across all months. Additionally, identifying the specific high demand and low demand products each months can help in planning and inventory management.

**4.Who are the top customers and how much they are contributing to the total revenue?**    

This information could be helpful to develop strategies for retaining the key customers and increasing business with others. Analyzing why customers contribute less- whether due to pricing, quality,or delivery or competitors offerings - can guide to improve overall income.

**As CMO is responsible for the company's marketing strategy and execution, so they might be interested in the following questions:**

**1.Who are the top customers that are contributing maximum to the total revenue and what patterns can we identify in their purchase behaviour? Are they repeating their orders or they are ordering the different products?** 

This analysis will help explain to the CMO about the top customers and who are buying from them more than once. Once this is identified, the CMO can come up with a strategy to target these customers with more offers and products that they would need. The analysis will also be done to see what they are buying the second time, this will provide the CMO trends into what products and sub products are in demand and then a marketing strategy can be devised to target these customers with better options.

**2.Which products or product categories are in high demand or low demand?**

This insight is helpful for planning inventory management effectively, avoiding overstock or stockouts, developing targeted marketing strategies to maximize the high demand items while improving the visibility of low demand products.                                  

**3.What are the seasonal or monthly trends in product demand and how can marketing campaigns be optimized to improve sale?**   

It is also important to analyze customer purchase behaviour to identify which customers are repeating orders most frequently and their contribution to revenue. For example, some customers may require the same products on a weekly or monthly basis, but these products may have a low monetary value, resulting in a smaller revenue contribution. Conversely, there may be customers who place large orders only once or twice a year, significantly impacting revenue. These customers tend to make purchases during specific months, making it essential for the management to ensure sufficient inventory is available to meet their demand during these periods. For customers with high order volumes but low revenue contributions, offering additional discounts or incentives could encourage them to buy in larger quantities, ultimately boosting overall revenue.                                                               

**4.Which country or regions are the underperforming and how we can increase sales in these areas through marketing campaigns?**

By identifying the countries which are underperforming, they could analyse the factors responsible for it such as lack of brand awareness, strong competition, poor distribution channel or pricing issues etc. Once this is identified, the CMO can plan the strategies like running campaigns and promotions of products to increase awareness of products, offering promotional discounts and offers to attract the new customers or to encourage the repeat purchase and collaboration with local retailers, distributors or influencers to strengthen the market presence etc. This targeted effort could help to attract the customers of those underperforming regions to improve the business in those areas.

**2. Choosing the Right Visuals (Task 2)**
- I identified and selected the best visualizations for each business scenario based on the requirements provided by the CEO and CMO.
- The task required careful consideration to ensure the visual representation was easy to interpret and conveyed the insights effectively. 
  I used best practices for choosing the right chart types, such as:
* Bar charts for comparing categories.
* Line graphs for showing trends over time.
* Pie charts for representing proportions.
- This step ensured that each metric was represented in the simplest, most effective manner to support clear decision-making.
  
**3. Creating Data Visualizations (Task 3)**
- After gathering the requirements and selecting appropriate visualizations, I used Power BI to create the visuals.
- The visuals focused on analyzing trends and breakdowns by categories to help the executives understand how revenue is generated and what 
  factors affect the business.
- I cleaned and preprocessed the data before building the visuals to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the analysis.
  
**4. Presenting Findings to Senior Leadership (Task 4)**
- The final task involved creating a video presentation to showcase the findings and explain the insights from the analysis.
- I provided an overview of the data, the analysis process, the visuals created, and the key insights that would help in business  
  expansion.
- I ensured that the presentation was clear, concise, and tailored to the needs of the CEO and CMO, focusing on areas that offer the most 
  potential for growth.
